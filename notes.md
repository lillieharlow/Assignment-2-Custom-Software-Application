# Assignment-2-Custom-Software-Application
Assignment 2 for Coder Academy - aka my first software application.

File IO
User input
Meaningful output
Accessing data from external sources

Design a functioning app - web browser OR terminal (CLI) in python.

Check List:
[] README.md file
    [] help or set up documentation - explain how to install any files & start the app
    [] hardware requirements
    [] features of the app
    [] dependencies required by the app
    [] list required files (third party)
        [] explaining the legal and ethical impacts of their license (+/-)
        [] security impact
        [] purpose
        [] not conflict with each other
[] uses 4+ third party libraries/packages (import ..., virtual environments - add to README for installing)
[] handle all errors - catch errors with error handling teechniques
[] use DRY principles across whole app
[] functions
    [] imported from third party libraries (extensive use)
    [] 6+ functions written by myself
[] 3+ classes
    [] uses inheritance and composition in at least two
[] variable scope & access delarations
[] loops and condiitonal statements
    [] for multiple paths
    [] nested structures that handle multiple contingencies
[] 2+ input and output
    [] retrieving user input and displaying output
    [] reading from files and writing to files
    [] req data from an API and displaying output

## DRY PRINCIPALS:

DRY = Don't Repeat Yourself
- A software development principle to avoid code duplication.
- Encourages writing modular, reusable, and clean code.

Why is DRY Important?
- Avoids Repetition
- Prevents writing the same logic multiple times.
- Improves Code Readability
- Easier to understand and maintain.
- Easier Maintenance
- Fixing bugs in one place updates all uses.
- Reduces Errors
- Less duplicated logic = fewer chances for mistakes.
- Supports Scalability
- Code can grow and evolve without becoming messy.
- Functions () , def function_name()
