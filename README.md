Workflow
App Launch: User is prompted for login or signup.

Login: Credentials are checked. On success, user‚Äôs task list is loaded.

Main Menu: Add, edit, remove, mark, or view tasks; fetch productivity tips; save/load.

Session End: Data is persisted; user can log out











Building a Fun & Colourful Terminal To-Do List Manager
Beginner-Friendly Step-by-Step Plan

Project Summary
Create a terminal-based To-Do List Manager app that:

Allows every user to sign up, log in, and save their own tasks.

Lets users add, view, complete, and delete tasks‚Äîreturning to their list any time.

Makes the user interface engaging with colors, ASCII art, and emojis.

Organizes code into separate modules for easy understanding and improvements.

Incorporates robust error handling and best coding practices.














Project Workflow


1. Setup & Planning
Decide where to store your project (a folder with subfolders: e.g., /todo_manager).

List the features you want: user login, task handling, colorful interface, persistent task-saving.

Note all third-party Python libraries you‚Äôll use:

- rich (colorful CLI output)

- pyfiglet (ASCII art text)

- pandas (for flexible data storage, optional)

- requests (optional, for API features)

- tabulate (pretty tables, optional)






2. Install Libraries
Open your terminal and run:

bash
pip install rich pyfiglet pandas requests tabulate
Step-by-Step Coding Plan
Step 1: Structure Your Project
Organize your project like this:

text
/todo_manager
  /auth
    - __init__.py          # Makes it a proper Python package
    - user.py
    - auth_manager.py
  /tasks
    - __init__.py          # Makes it a proper Python package
    - task.py
    - tasklist.py
  /cli
    - __init__.py          # Makes it a proper Python package
    - menu.py
    - theme.py
  /data                    # Optional: separate folder for data files
    - users.json
    - tasks_*.json
  /tests                   # Optional: unit tests
    - test_auth.py
    - test_tasks.py
  - storage.py
  - manager.py
  - main.py
  - requirements.txt
  - README.md
  - .gitignore            # Ignore data files, __pycache__, etc.


Each file/module will focus on a different piece of functionality.





Step 2: Implement User Authentication
Create a User class (auth/user.py) to handle user data.

Write an AuthManager (auth/auth_manager.py):

Allow new users to sign up (choose username & password).

Store hashed passwords securely (you can use simple hashing for now, like Python‚Äôs hashlib).

Validate credentials on login.

Handle errors (e.g., username taken, wrong password).

Step 3: Build the Task System
Make a Task class in tasks/task.py to represent each to-do item.

Optionally add a RecurringTask subclass to try inheritance.

Build a TaskList class (tasks/tasklist.py) that contains a user‚Äôs list and functions to add, mark, remove, and list tasks.

Step 4: Develop the CLI Interface
In cli/theme.py, create functions for:

Colorful welcome banners (using rich and pyfiglet)

Menu options (styled and decorated with emojis)

Color-coded task display tables

In cli/menu.py, code the flow for:

Login/signup prompts

Main menu (add/view/delete/complete tasks, log out)

Repeatedly show menus based on user actions

Step 5: Handle Data Storage
Use storage.py to read/write users‚Äô task data (JSON or CSV format, using pandas or built-in json module).

Save each user's tasks to a separate file (e.g., tasks_{username}.json).

Step 6: Connect Components in the Manager
In manager.py, link authentication, task logic, and the CLI menus:

After login, load user‚Äôs tasks

Route menu actions to add/view/delete/complete

On logout or exit, save tasks

Step 7: Entry Point
In main.py, start the app by showing theme banner, prompting login/signup, then letting users manage tasks.

Use loops and conditionals to allow users to repeat actions, handle errors, and navigate.

Step 8: Polish & Test
Add try/except error handling everywhere user input or files are accessed.

Make sure colors, ASCII art, and emojis display as you‚Äôd like.

Test each feature as you add it‚Äîfix bugs as you find them.

Recommendations for Beginners
Go module by module; treat each as a mini-project.

Start simple (single user, plain CLI), then add color, fun, and modularity step by step.

Use plenty of comments and docstrings to explain what your code does.

Try using version control (git) to save your progress as you learn.
